        <h4>What is Sustainability?</h4>
        <p>Sustainability is a big word, sometimes a scary word. We hear it so much when we talk about being environmentally-friendly and doing our part to help the planet. The term is applied to almost everything relating to climate change. But what is sustainability really and how do we go about being sustainable? To understand that, we must first understand the meaning of sustainability. The dictionary definition of sustainability means understanding that resources we have here on planet Earth are finite, and using them in a way that allows them to be sustained, or last for long periods of time. It’s a multi-step process: you must first raise your own awareness of what it means to be sustainable, be willing to learn and understand how you can change your own habits to be more sustainable, and then actually making those lifestyle changes and sticking to them. Trying to be more sustainable can seem like a daunting task because so many of the things we’ve normalized as a society are by nature not sustainable. Where do we even start? How do we make those lifestyle changes? What even are those lifestyle changes!? But worry not, because that’s where we come in! Our quiz will help you understand sustainability in the context of everyday life.

        <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
        <p>	Earth’s resources aren’t never-ending, and if we aren’t aware of and respectful of that fact, we’ll over-use those resources and future generations won’t have much of them. Sustainability allows us to respect the finite-ness of Earth’s resources so we can make them last as long as we possibly can, and not over-use them. It’s something that we all need to work towards because one person being sustainable alone can’t make a difference: it is a collective responsibility. If you understand sustainability in your own life, it makes it easier to implement it and take responsibility. It’s an important foundational step. In a world without sustainability, the climate change crisis would be exacerbated. And while sustainability needs to happen in combination with action from governments and the people in charge, sustainability is a starting point and is where the people’s involvement comes from. So take our quiz, self-evaluate your sustainability habits, and understand how you can improve to start the process for yourself. You got this!
