        <p>Uh oh. Looks like you haven’t really been that sustainable lately. But that’s okay, here are some things that can help you become more eco-friendly!

Let’s start with food. You throw out food at least once a week, which is a lot of food waste. The next time you throw away food, try to ask yourself why you had to throw it out. Did you buy too much of it? Did you buy it knowing you wouldn’t be able to finish it? Think consciously about why you threw it away so you can reduce the amount of food you throw out. To avoid having to throw out food, you should buy only what you need, and whenever you are about to buy food, specifically produce, ask yourself if you can finish it before it spoils. If you’re doubtful, don’t buy it. When buying food in bulk, ask yourself the same question, and if your answer is no, you should buy a smaller quantity of it. And when you do have food waste that can be composted, always compost it. (Learn about composting here: https://dontwastethecrumbs.com/composting-basics-for-beginners/ ) Also, for groceries, you should invest in a durable reusable bag so you never have to use plastic bags. Put it in your car or somewhere you know you’ll see it before you leave the door so you bring it every time you go grocery shopping.

        <p>Next is water and electricity. Always unplug or turn off devices like lamps or the TV when not in use, and always turn off the lights when you leave the room. Also always turn the faucet off while you’re brushing your teeth or washing your face. If you tend to forget turning the lights or water off, maybe leave yourself a sticky note near the switch to remind yourself. You should also switch to LED lights and wash your clothes in cold water if you can, or at least warm water instead of hot.

Finally, we have transportation. Try to use public transportation sometimes, and if possible, try to switch to a hybrid or electric car. Also, try to find people at work or school that you can carpool with. When driving, try not to speed or accelerate unnecessarily. Practice driving with consistent speed.

A great way to learn more about making a difference is to attend environmental rights protests and participate in environmental organizations! Here are some resources for that: https://greendreamer.com/journal/environmental-organizations-nonprofits-for-a-sustainable-future.

Overall, you need to work on implementing sustainability in your life. Hopefully these tips help you!

        <p>You’re doing a lot better than most of your peers, which is a great start! But you still have a lot of room for improvement. So what can you do?

Let’s start with food. Though you don’t have much food go to waste every week, you still do throw away food before it's used a few times a month. To avoid having to throw out food, you should buy only what you need, and whenever you are about to buy food, specifically produce, ask yourself if you can finish it before it spoils. If you’re doubtful, don’t buy it. When buying food in bulk, ask yourself the same question, and if your answer is no, you should buy a smaller quantity of it. And when you do have food waste that can be composted, always compost it. You indicated that you compost sometimes, which is a perfect start! But you can do it more often. (More resources for composting here: https://dontwastethecrumbs.com/composting-basics-for-beginners/ ) Also, for groceries, you should invest in a durable reusable bag so you never have to use plastic bags. If you tend to forget it, put it in your car or somewhere you know you’ll see it before you leave the door.

Let’s start with food. You rarely have throw out food, which is great. The next time you throw away food, try to ask yourself why you had to throw it out. Did you buy too much of it? Did you buy it knowing you wouldn’t be able to finish it? Think consciously about why you threw it away so you can move from rarely throwing out food to never throwing out food. And when you do have food waste that can be composted, always compost it. You indicated that you compost sometimes, which is a perfect start! But you can do it more often.
